# the userInfoUri is by far not the only way of hooking a resource server up with a way to decode tokens.
# In fact itâ€™s sort of a lowest common denominator (and not part of the spec), but quite often available from OAuth2
# providers (like Facebook, Cloud Foundry, Github), and other choices are available. For instance you can encode the
# user authentication in the token itself (e.g. with JWT), or use a shared backend store. There is also a /token_info
# endpoint in CloudFoundry, which provides more detailed information than the user info endpoint, but which requires
# more thorough authentication. Different options (naturally) provide different benefits and trade-offs, but a full
# discussion of those is outside the scope of this section.
